# PushDialer Chrome Extension

Adds support for dialing phone numbers in Chrome by selecting the number and
bringing up the context menu to expose the "Dial _XXX-XXX-XXXX_ on iPhone" item.

This extension is only useful on Mac OS X 10.5, since PushDialer also exposes
a system-wide "Dial Number on iPhone" service on 10.6+. In the future, this
extension will also be useful for Windows users, once PushDialer support for
Windows is released.
